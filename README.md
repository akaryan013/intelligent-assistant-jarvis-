# intelligent-assistant-jarvis-
It is a voice assistant which can be used to interact with your computer and also you have been seeing it in Iron man movies, but this JARVIS is not that much advanced as shown in movies.

I have wrote code which you can use JARVIS in the following ways : 
 It can Open YouTube. 
 It can search on Wikipedia 
 It can open stackoverflow 
 It can play music 
 It can tell you the current time. 
 It can email to any person 
 It can talk to you about some issues like feeling sad, how is he etc 
 It can open the path of code 
These are the following modules used in JARVIS😉 : 
SpeechRecognisation | PyAudio | pyttsx3 | datetime | wikipedia | requests 
| smtplib | os | webbrowser | pipwin 

Installation: 
 Setup the code in your pc. 
 Install the above modules using pip 
pip install SpeechRecognisation 
pip install pipwin 
pip install pyaudio 
pip install Wikipedia 
pip install datetime 
pip install pyttsx3 
pip install smtplib 
 Now you are ready to run the program 
 Write “python -m main” in your cmd and hit enter. 
 Now When “Listening..” is come on screen give your 
command and that’s it.
